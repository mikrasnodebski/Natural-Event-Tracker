# Natural-Event-Tracker

Destination and description of the project:
The destination of the project was to create an application to track fires,
storms, volcanic eruptions and other natural events based on
information from the NASA API. The application generates
map with markers that shows where in a particular place
there is an current natural event in the world. "Current"  means one that has not ended
until the program starts. There is an additional option to filter events based on their categories.
Filter menu contains only a set of non-repeating event categories on the map.
